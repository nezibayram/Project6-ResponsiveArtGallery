      <p id="p2">In my art gallery I have depicted images of women using various mosaic and shape stencils.
        Art arises from visual impressions from reality and from forms that we interpret and modify. 
        Even the Neolithic people decorated their caves with drawings from their reality. 
        This shows that people viewed language and images as inseparable in order to communicate with each other.<br>
        Today, humanity is so advanced that machines with artificial intelligence generate art. Human art is very beautiful, but so is KI art. It's nice that we have both.
     <br> You have the option to view my art gallery in dark mode or light mode.<br>
